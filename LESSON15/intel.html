        <h1>WAKE UP TO REALITY. NOTHING EVER GOES AS PLANNED IN THIS ACCURSED WORLD. THE
        LONGER YOU LIVE, THE MORE YOU REALIZE THAT THE ONLY THINGS THAT TRULY EXIST IN THIS REALITY ARE MERELY PAIN,
        SUFFERING, AND FUTILITY. LISTEN‚Ä¶ EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK IN THIS WORLD, WHEREVER THERE IS LIGHT ‚Äî THERE WILL ALWAYS
        BE SHADOWS TO BE FOUND AS WELL. AS LONG AS THERE IS A CONCEPT OF VICTORS, THE VANQUISHED WILL ALSO EXIST. THE
        SELFISH DESIRE OF WANTING TO MAINTAIN PEACE CAUSES WARS, AND HATRED IS BORN IN ORDER TO PROTECT LOVE. </h1>
