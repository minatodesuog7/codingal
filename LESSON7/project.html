    <p id="id1">The old woman sat by her window, watching the monsoon clouds roll in. A faint smell of
        turmeric and sandalwood hung in the air, a comforting reminder of her past. She closed her eyes, remembering
        laughter and songs, a life vibrant with love and loss. A gentle breeze ruffled the curtains, and the rain began
        to fall, washing away the dust of years. She smiled, a single tear tracing a path down her wrinkled cheek, and
        whispered, "Home." The storm outside echoed the quiet in her heart, a symphony of sorrow and serenity.

        the day and
        night. He came upon a large juicy bone one day and instantly grabbed it between his teeth and carried it home.
        He passed a river on his way home and came upon another dog with a bone in its teeth.The old woman sat by her
